# Scrum Project Tracking System


## Overview
The purpose of our project is to develop an application that could potentially be used by a scrum development team that allows for planning and tracking of development sprints. 

 Major features planned for this application include:
 
* The ability to plan development sprints, including associated backlog tasks 

* The ability to track the status of backlog deliverables during a sprint

* The ability for development team members to view sprint status and assignments in a dashboard-like interface

* The ability for business users to submit stories to the product backlog

* The ability for users to export sprint and project data to various file formats, including spreadsheet and PDF

* The ability to maintain user accounts

As scrum development requires consistent and efficient collaboration among several members of a development team, our project tracking application is intended for multi-user transactional activity.  Accordingly, it will utilize a SQL database backend for data storage.  The frontend will be written in C#, utilizing the Windows Forms (Winforms) library for GUI development and Entity Framework for data access.
