# Scrum Project Tracking System
## Project Testing Overview

### Unit Testing
Unit tests are present in project **ScrumProjectTrackingTest**.  Unit tests use a class implementing the corresponding data access interface and use a series of List  objects to mimic database storage functionality.

The following unit tests have been developed:

 - **SprintTaskListUnitTests** - testing of data access logic used in class SprintTaskList which displays the sprint tasks associated with a specific sprint/project/team/user.
 - **SprintTaskDetailUnitTests** - testing of data access and validation logic used in class TaskDetail which displays and allows updates to the detail associated with a specific sprint task.
 - **SprintsListUnitTests** - testing of data access logic used in class SprintsList which displays sprints meeting a specified criteria along with aggregate sprint task information.

### User Interface Testing
Minor testing of the user interface has been conducted by visual inspection; more comprehensive User Acceptance Testing is planned.
